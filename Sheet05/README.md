# Deep Learning Sheet 05 

- 05_1_DQN.ipynb contains exercise 1. Note that only part a) works properly, there is a mistake somewhere in b), as it does not perform better than a)
- 05_2.ipynb contain exercise2. The code looks fine we think, but the plots indicate that it does not converge to a good policy. 
- 05_submission_Adam_Grunert_Ullmann.pdf contain the plots and reflections for exercise 1 and 2.
